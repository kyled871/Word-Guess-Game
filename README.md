# [KYLE VS DRYWALL](https://kyled871.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/)

## Are you a Kyle?
See if you have what it takes by fighting a Kyle's natural enemy...**drywall**.
The Rules are simple... spell the secret word that only a Kyle would know:

* If you guess the correct word you'll increase your `Lives` by `2` points.
* If your lives run out, the Kyle on the screen will meet his demise.

**GOOD LUCK**

*This project is to show simple DOM manipulation using vanilla javascript to control the game's logic and appearence.*
